## Data Visualisation using R Programming

This is a tutorial I made for UCL Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis (CASA) Summer School Program in 2019, for a complete repo click [here](https://github.com/ss-asm/SS-ASM19-Materials). It provides a tutorial for interactive visualisation in R programming using Plotly, Shiny, ggplot2. The data used is Airbnb data in London from [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html) that is already pre-processed and aggregated into Borough level.

The last part of the tutorial is using Shiny to create interactive website for simple regression analysis.
